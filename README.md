# Recruiting journey
A recruiting journey is a dynamic and evolving process that begins with identifying talent needs and ends with securing the right candidate for the role. It involves close collaboration between recruiters, hiring managers, and teams to define key skills and qualifications. Throughout the journey, recruiters actively engage with potential candidates, assess their fit, and guide them through interviews and evaluations. Along the way, they navigate challenges, build relationships, and ensure a positive candidate experience, all while aligning talent with organizational goals for long-term success..
